# TO DO:
# UMLS API Key?????? To help map
# Modify code so that if the variable is a null value, just delete it
# Build ordered data structure to store all the nodes and edges chronilogically, so that branchClassifier can go back and change the branch_flags
# Need to do better job with the clinical data, it is not putting anything in right now

    You are an assistant that converts clinical case narratives into dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

    Each DAG consists of:
    - Nodes = snapshots of the patient's state.
    - Edges = transitions between those states.

    Terminology guidance:
    - Use UMLS-standard concepts when possible for consistency and interoperability.
    - If a concept isn't covered by UMLS, use clear, logical labeling.
    """,

    "node_instructions": 
        """
    Each node represents the patient at a specific point in time or logical step.

    Guidelines for nodes:
    - Define nodes based on distinct clinical events or logical transitions.
    - Combine simultaneous lab and imaging results into a single node.
    - Use separate nodes when events are clearly sequential or clinically distinct.

    Node fields:
    - node_id (required): Unique identifier (Use capital letters in sequence: "A", "B", "C", etc.)
    - node_step_index (required): Integer for sequence ordering
    - content (required): All relevant content describing the node
    - timestamp (optional): ISO 8601 datetime, include only if explicitly available (e.g., "2025-03-01T10:00:00Z")

    Specific fields:
    Each node includes an optional structured field `clinical_data`, formatted as a dictionary with categories mapping to lists of dictionaries. Values should only be included if matched to the UMLS Metathesaurus; otherwise, omit and do not print/store it.

    Each edge represents a change from one node to another.

    Guidelines for edges:
    - Create edges only when there is a clear clinical progression or change between nodes.
    - Maintain narrative or logical order â€” edges should flow from earlier to later events.
    - Combine co-occurring findings into the same node, not across multiple edges.

    Explicit guidelines for node boundaries:
    - edge_id (required): Unique identifier (Use format "node_id"_to_"node_id", such that the first "node_id" is the upstream node and the second "node_id" is the downstream node bounding the edge)
    - branch_flag (required): Boolean if this starts a side branch

Initial outpatient labs, including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, were unremarkable. A chest X-ray revealed a left upper lobe opacity, prompting referral to pulmonology. High-resolution CT of the chest demonstrated a 4.2 cm spiculated mass in the left upper lobe with associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy. PET-CT confirmed hypermetabolic activity in the mass and mediastinal nodes without distant metastasis. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy was performed, and histopathology revealed poorly differentiated non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Molecular testing showed no actionable mutations. The patient was staged as clinical stage IIB (T2bN1M0) and discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board. He was deemed a surgical candidate and underwent left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection via VATS. Pathology confirmed NSCLC with negative margins but 2/12 positive nodes, confirming stage IIB disease. He recovered well postoperatively without complications and was discharged home on postoperative day three. Following recovery, he was referred to medical oncology, and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy was initiated six weeks post-surgery. He completed four cycles of chemotherapy over three months without major adverse effects aside from mild fatigue and nausea. Surveillance imaging at three months post-treatment showed no evidence of disease recurrence. He continues routine follow-up every three months with thoracic surgery and oncology. The case highlights the importance of early symptom recognition, timely referral, and coordinated multidisciplinary care in managing operable lung cancer."

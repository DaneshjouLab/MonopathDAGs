It has a rapid progression and poor prognosis and is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. The efficacy of molecular-targeted drugs for patients with PPC with targetable driver mutations has been reported. However, most molecular-targeted drugs are administered orally, limiting their application in cases where oral administration is difficult. We report the case of a 78-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IIA lung cancer. He underwent lobectomy and was pathologically diagnosed with PPC harboring a BRAF-V600E mutation. His lung cancer recurred two months postoperatively with multiple metastases, including those in the small intestine, which caused intussusception and ileus. Because the resected specimen from the small intestinal tumor resembled the histopathological results of the preoperative lung tissue, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib could be effective. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) tube was placed on the anal side of the intussusception site to depressurize intragastric pressure, allowing drug administration while decompressing the stomach. Treatment initiated for a few days improved abdominal symptoms, and computed tomography (CT) revealed tumor shrinkage. This is the first reported case of a patient with malignant intestinal obstruction successfully treated with targeted therapy drugs administered via a PEG-J tube, which is a viable method for patients with NSCLC with driver mutations who cannot take oral medications or via a nasogastric tube. Furthermore, therapies targeting driver mutations may be effective for patients with PPC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12048111/?report=classic,Higashi et al..

40322404,PMC12050122,Uncovering the True Diagnosis: A Case Report of Multilocular Peritoneal Inclusion Cyst.,Cureus,2025,Al-Saghir M; Gaishauser K; Al-Wahab ZR,"Peritoneal inclusion cysts (PICs) are rare, benign cystic tumors predominantly found in premenopausal females. They often present diagnostic challenges due to their asymptomatic nature and non-specific imaging features, requiring biopsy and immunohistochemistry for a definitive diagnosis. This report presents a case of a large, multilocular PIC initially misdiagnosed as a lymphangioma. A 29-year-old asymptomatic nulliparous female presented for follow-up after an abdominal ultrasound, conducted during a complicated cystitis workup, incidentally revealed a notable fluid collection adjacent to the spleen. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a complex cystic lesion in the left upper quadrant, measuring 7.6 x 11.7 cm. The finding was interpreted as a lymphangioma. Over six months, the lesion doubled in size, prompting further evaluation and doxycycline sclerotherapy. Despite eight months of treatment, the patient began to experience persistent symptoms of abdominal pressure, sharp groin pain, and decreased appetite. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the lesion had grown to 7.0 x 17.1 x 34.6 cm. An incisional biopsy confirmed PICs through pathology and immunohistochemistry. Genetic testing for hereditary cancer was negative. The patient underwent extensive surgical resection involving multiple organs, ultimately achieving no gross residual disease. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges posed by PICs and the necessity of biopsy for accurate diagnosis, differentiating them from lymphangiomas. It emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and individualized treatment plans when managing PICs. Continued research and long-term follow-up are essential for refining treatment strategies for this rare condition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12050122/?report=classic,Al-Saghir et al..

A 68-year-old female patient with no smoking history presented with a cough and headache. She was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, stage T1cN3M1c IVb, which included multiple brain metastases. An IGR (downstream MAN1A1) ROS1:exon34 fusion was detected at a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 12.73%, accompanied by two TP53 mutations c.1024C>T (p.R342*) and c.686_687del (p.C229Yfs*10). The resultant fusion protein preserves the whole TRKA kinase domain of ROS1, and therefore may constitutively activate ROS1.Therefore, RNA-seq was conducted to further confirm the expression of IGR-ROS1 fusion at mRNA level. A CD74:exon6 ~ ROS1: exon 35 fusion was identified, which could mediate the full kinase function. A biopsy of the right supraclavicular lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. She was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, stage T1cN3M1c IVb, which included multiple brain metastases. The patient began treatment with entrectinib (600 mg, once daily) as a first-line therapy. At the time of diagnosis, the patient reported headaches and experienced sleep disturbances.

The patient had been diagnosed with extensive small-cell lung cancer 15 months previously. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed suprahepatic compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the level of its entry into the right atrium, caused by a space-occupying, infiltrating right lung lesion. Inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) occurs after obstruction of venous flow through the IVC. Trunk and lower limb edema are the most common manifestations of this syndrome, whereas cardiac function may be compromised in more severe cases. Given the patient's performance status, disease stage, and symptom acuity, endovascular stenting of the IVC was preferred over surgery or radiotherapy. The superior vena cava (SVC)-to-IVC bridging stent approach was employed to address the severe mass effect and location of the IVC stenosis at its junction with the right atrium. Three uncovered self-expandable stents were deployed in tandem from the SVC to the IVC. Overlap between stents minimized the risk of collapse within the right atrium, possibly leading to cardiac conduction disorders or even perforation of the heart wall. The patient experienced alleviation of IVCS symptoms over the next 48 h but unfortunately passed away 8 days later from his primary disease.

A 66-year-old man was found to have a suspicious nodule in the left lower lung zone during a routine chest X-ray as part of a medical checkup. CT suggested lung cancer in the left lower lobe, prompting referral to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Contrasted CT imaging revealed a ground-glass nodule with a maximum diameter of 4.6 cm, including a 4 cm solid component, located in segments S9/10 of the left lower lobe. No signs of emphysema were observed, and pulmonary function tests indicated normal respiratory capacity. PET-CT showed mild uptake (SUVmax 2.04) in the left lower lobe mass, with no evidence of distant metastasis. Additionally, contrast-enhanced brain MRI showed no abnormalities suggestive of metastasis. Bronchoscopy was performed, but transbronchial lung biopsy and brushing/irrigation cytology yielded no evidence of malignancy. Based on these findings, stage IB primary lung cancer was suspected, and a surgical biopsy followed by lobectomy was planned. The procedure was conducted using a four-port, completely thoracoscopic approach. Intraoperative needle biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, leading to left lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Immediately after chest wound closure, a large volume of air leakage was observed, along with pneumatocele formation and perforation on the mediastinal side of the upper lobe. The pneumatocele was incised, its base cauterized, and covered with a TachoSil<sup>¬Æ</sup> fibrin sealant patch (CSL Behring, King of Prussia, PA, USA). Postoperatively, a mild air leak persisted, requiring a single session of adhesive therapy. Lung fragility and increased negative intrathoracic pressure following resection are key risk factors for pneumatocele formation. While most cases can be managed conservatively, surgical intervention should be considered in symptomatic cases, particularly those presenting with pneumothorax or hemoptysis. If a pneumatocele develops intraoperatively, positive pressure ventilation and compression may cause further expansion. Therefore, we recommend prompt incision to prevent enlargement, followed by air leak closure through cauterization of the base and application of a sealing material.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12022811/?report=classic,Matsuoka et al..

AVWS was suspected based on a qualitative deficiency in von Willebrand factor (VWF), with abnormal results for factor VIII activity (FVIII:C), VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), and VWF ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:Rco) (40%, 20%, and <2.4%, respectively). Further evaluation revealed the presence of an IgM kappa monoclonal spike, suggesting MGUS. In 2022, the patient was diagnosed with NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation and initiated second-line treatment with sotorasib. Notably, one year after the initiation of sotorasib therapy, the patient's hemostasis had normalized, accompanied by significant improvements in VWF levels. VWF multimer electrophoresis demonstrated the restoration of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs), and serum protein electrophoresis no longer detected MGUS. <b>Conclusion:</b> These improvements were likely attributable to the indirect effects of sotorasib on the bone marrow microenvironment. By inhibiting KRAS in stromal cells and osteoclasts, sotorasib may have disrupted the supportive niche necessary for malignant plasma cell survival, resulting in a reduction in the monoclonal spike.

FGFR inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of tumors harboring these fusions. While FGFR1 amplification has been well-documented in numerous NSCLC datasets, the characterization of specific FGFR fusion variants remains limited. In this study, we identified a novel PLPP5-FGFR1 fusion in a 65-year-old male patient with lung squamous cell carcinoma through targeted RNA sequencing. The fusion junction was located between exon 1 of PLPP5 and exon 5 of FGFR1, and the result was validated by Sanger sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a PLPP5-FGFR1 fusion coexisting with a TP53 mutation in LUSC.

A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of a physical examination that revealed a space-occupying lung. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed right upper lung cancer with multiple tiny nodules in both lungs (suspected metastatic foci), and the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the right lung was confirmed by aspiration biopsy. In the same period, thyroid nodules were detected by ultrasound and puncture, and papillary thyroid cancer was confirmed by pathology. After multidisciplinary consultation, a systemic treatment plan was drawn up, and changes in the lung nodules were observed. The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy and one cycle of targeted therapy, and the follow-up examination showed shrinkage of the upper lobe of the right lung but stabilization of the intrapulmonary nodule. Still, a mass was visible under the skin on the right neck. Given the abnormal ultrasound of lymph nodes in the V region of the neck and the puncture suggestive of a spindle cell soft tissue tumor, the team of specialists performed radical surgery after a comprehensive evaluation, including resection of the upper lobe of the right lung, systematic lymph node dissection, and enlarged resection of the neck mass. Postoperative pathology finally confirmed that the neck lesion was MIFS.

With the increase of its incidence and the development of medical technology, the overall survival of lung cancer patients has significantly extended compared to before. The incidence of brain and meningeal metastases from lung cancer has also been rising year by year, but patients with brain and meningeal metastases from lung cancer have a poor prognosis and a very high mortality rate, and the diagnosis is mainly based on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging examinations. However, the imaging features are diverse and the specificity is low, which makes it easy to be misdiagnosed and missed. Therefore, accurately identifying brain and meningeal metastases and timely targeted treatment is crucial for improving patient prognosis. This paper analyzed the diagnosis and treatment of a case of lung cancer with no obvious recurrence and metastasis in nearly 7-year long-term follow-up after radical lung cancer surgery, but the patient with abnormal behavior, impaired consciousness and epilepsy in the past 5 months, and multiple punctate calcifications in the brain found by head CT and MRI. This paper consider that the patient's mental and behavioral symptoms were caused by brain and meningeal metastasis of lung cancer after excluding infectious disease and ineffective treatment of autoimmune encephalitis, and further pathological biopsy and genetic detection confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L858R gene mutation, and the patient's symptoms were significantly improved after targeted therapy by Osimertinib. This paper also searched the relevant literatures of brain calcifications in databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, UpToDate, PubMed, etc., and found that intracerebral calcifications exist in a variety of diseases, including infectious, genetic and neurodegenerative diseases, vascular diseases, metabolic diseases and tumors. However, brain calcification in brain and meningeal metastases are often underestimated, and the consequent risk is misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.

With nonspecific symptoms and diagnostic challenges, definitive diagnosis relies on histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. This study reviews the current research on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MPM, focusing on preserving fertility and achieving successful childbirth following surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, despite immune-related adverse events. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 44-year-old nulliparous woman, initially diagnosed with a uterine leiomyoma, who was incidentally found to have MPM during surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopy and subsequent imaging revealed extensive peritoneal involvement, confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The patient's desire to preserve fertility complicated the treatment approach, leading to chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy, with complete disease control. Without evidence of disease recurrence or metastasis, the patient proceeded with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer. During an emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks 2 days of gestation, performed due to preterm premature rupture of membranes, intraabdominal residual tumors were discovered and excised. No evidence of malignancy was found elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS MPM is a rare disease, often with a delayed diagnosed due to nonspecific symptoms. Treatments like cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) improve survival for operable cases, while systemic therapies and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are options for inoperable cases; however, further research on early-detection biomarkers and the impact of ICIs on fertility is needed to enhance clinical practice.

Nearly 94% of patients with ascites have non-malignant etiologies, with the most common being chronic liver disease. Peritoneal mesothelioma is an exceedingly rare malignancy associated with asbestos exposure. Here, we report the case of an elderly man who presented with recurrent loculated ascites and received a diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma after a delay of approximately 10 weeks. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old man with a history of asbestos exposure presented with abdominal distension and muscle wasting for 1 month. Initial abdominal CT was notable for smooth liver contour and massive ascites. Ascitic fluid analysis was consistent with low serum albumin-ascites gradient but showed negative cytology for malignant cells. Upper and lower endoscopies did not reveal lesions. Due to recurring ascites, serial abdominal paracenteses were performed, although cytology was negative for malignant cells. Repeat abdominal CT performed after 6 weeks showed worsening loculated ascites, with possible peritoneal carcinomatosis. At this point, percutaneous omental biopsy was performed, which established the diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma (75 days after initial presentation). CONCLUSIONS In patients presenting with recurrent ascites and a history of asbestos exposure, it is important to consider the diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma. While 94% of patients with ascites have non-malignant etiologies, a small proportion of patients can have malignant ascites.

PARP inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer. However, studies focusing on the association between the BRCA gene and NSCLC, as well as the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in NSCLC, are scarce. Here, we present the case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR and somatic BRCA2 mutations, who developed resistance to third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and subsequently exhibited durable response to Olaparib. This case exemplifies the remarkable efficacy of precision-targeted therapy in combination with intrathecal chemotherapy, which has resulted in significant clinical improvement for an EGFR- and BRCA-mutant lung cancer patient suffering from severe and symptomatic leptomeningeal metastases. Our findings provide clinical evidence and guidance for the treatment of NSCLC patients with BRCA mutations.

Because of the rarity and non-specific symptoms, it often requires clinicians to have a high degree of suspicion to make an early diagnosis of lung torsion. Here we present a unique case of lung torsion. The patient was a 73-year-old lady who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lung. She was treated with radiotherapy, which resulted in complete remission. However, her follow-up imaging showed torsion of the right lung. Given her lack of clinical symptoms, she was managed conservatively. This is a unique case and possibly the first reported case of lung torsion following radiotherapy.

40166516,PMC11955559,Brain Metastasis From Advanced-Stage Lung Carcinoma: Differentiating From Stroke and Exploring Treatment and Prevention Methods.,Cureus,2025,Sims K; Saliba N; Goldhagen M,"Metastasis is one of the most significant contributors to mortality and treatment-related morbidity in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer, as it is often considered incurable once discovered. Accordingly, a significant challenge with metastasis is identifying its progression early, as initial imaging may be negative while metastasis propagates undetected. Hence, there is a growing consensus that determining the optimal frequency and improving screening protocols for brain metastasis in patients with lung cancer are essential areas of research, as earlier detection could allow for prompt adjustments in treatment and/or prophylactic interventions, thereby potentially improving outcomes and reducing risks associated with more invasive procedures. Moreover, another difficulty in the diagnosis of brain metastasis can arise from its symptom overlap with strokes, often necessitating methods such as the use of the visual-aphasia-neglect assessment scale, as well as accounting for patient history and timeline of symptoms, with definitive diagnosis established through a head CT/MRI. This report presents a patient with a history of a tobacco use disorder, upper esophageal stricture, and a one-year history of advanced stage III non-small-cell lung carcinoma who reported to the emergency department (ED) with concerns of neurological weakness where multiple lesions with vasogenic edema were discovered on head CT, suggestive of brain metastasis. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where he was treated with dexamethasone and subsequent MRI confirmed the diagnosis of brain metastasis. He was discharged home to begin whole brain radiation therapy with orders to temporarily hold his chemotherapy medication. The patient initially responded well, but most recent CT scans have indicated progression of metastasis to bone and gastrointestinal organs.¬†Thus, earlier recognition of impending brain metastasis, especially in advanced-stage lung carcinoma, is a significant area of research, as timely detection can have decisive impacts on patient outcomes and possible interventions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11955559/?report=classic,Sims et al..

These 2 entities are attributed to older age, with a mean age of around 70 years old. Here, we present 3 fatal cases of lung cancer and COPD in uncommonly young patients (45-55 years old). CASE REPORT The first patient, 46-year-old man, reported progressive tiredness, and recurrent sub-febrile states, without recovery despite empiric treatment with 3 antibiotics. He was diagnosed with SCC and referred for chemoradiotherapy, but he died within 6 months. The second patient was 53-year-old women with hemoptysis, tiredness, loss of weight, spine pain, and cough, who was first diagnosed with pneumonia. Her first bronchoscopy was not diagnostic. A second bronchoscopy performed 2 weeks later was successful and she was diagnosed with large-cell carcinoma. She was referred for chemoradiotherapy, but died within 1 month. The third patient was 50-year-old women with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder and hoarseness. She was diagnosed with advanced SCLC, and was referred immediately for chemotherapy with immunotherapy, but did not respond well to treatment and died a few months later. CONCLUSIONS Age seems to be one of the factors that can delay cancer diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, the literature contains no reports about young patients with coexistence of lung cancer and COPD.

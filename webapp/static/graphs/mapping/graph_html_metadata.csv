Diagnosed with SCLC 15 months previously. Received 6 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. Lost 20 kg of body weight within 12 months. Performance status was recorded (4) on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale on the day of admission. Vital signs: systolic/diastolic blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, oxygen saturation 89%, body temperature 36,9°C/98° F. Laboratory results: hemoglobin 12,6 g/dl (normal range 14-18 g/dl), platelets 260 × 103/μl (150-450 × 103/μl), alkaline phosphatase 94 U/L (26-112 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 40 U/L (5-35 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 34 U/L (<40 U/L), total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dl. A large tumor involving the right lower and middle lung lobe measured (17,6 × 19,3 × 18,6) mm (maximal axial x coronal x sagittal dimension), which causes significant compression of the IVC (yellow arrows) mainly at the level of its entry into the right heart atrium. Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, infiltration of the visceral pleura and right hemidiaphragm, ascites, and peritoneal metastases were other salient findings underlining disease progression.

Three self-expanding stents (yellow arrows) were positioned in tandem from the superior vena cava (SVC) (red arrow shows the most cephalic part of the stents) to the IVC to restore venous patency. Fig. 3. The final venography revealed adequate flow through the bridging stents (yellow arrows). The patient's IVCS symptoms, mainly trunk and lower limb edema, were significantly alleviated within 48 h. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered for anticoagulation.

A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung, raising the suspicion of a malignant tumor (MT). Subsequent positron electron tomography (PET)-CT indicated an irregular lobulated soft tissue mass in the apical segment of the right lung upper lobe, measuring approximately 4.1×3.5 cm and showing increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (SUV value) and spiculated margins, suggestive of lung cancer (likely squamous cell carcinoma). There were tiny nodular shadows about 0.3 cm in diameter surrounding the mass, and the possibility of metastasis was not ruled out. Several enlarged lymph nodes were visible in regions 10R, 4R, and 2R, the largest measuring approximately 1.7 cm in diameter. that showed varying degrees of increased FDG uptake, suggesting possible metastasis in some lymph nodes. On March 3, 2023, a CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe lung mass was performed at our hospital. According to the pathology report (Figure 1), combined with the patient’s medical history and immunohistochemical markers, squamous cell carcinoma was considered (Note: CK7-, CK20-, CK5/6-, NapsinA-, CD56-, P40+, Syn-, CgA-, CD56-, TTF-1-, Ki-67 75%).

Grade III thrombocytopenia occurred post-treatment, with a nadir of 30 × 10^9/L. Immunotherapy regimen was adjusted for the first cycle: tislelizumab 200 mg on d0 + paclitaxel liposome 120 mg on d1, 90 mg on d8 + carboplatin 150 mg on d2, 100 mg on d3-5, every 3 weeks (q3w). However, on May 16, 2023, bacteremia and herpes zoster infection were observed, so antitumor treatment was halted.","Vancomycin was given for anti-infection and anti-viral treatment. After active treatment, the first reexamination on May 29, 2023, with a repeat enhanced chest CT showed an irregular thin-walled cystic lesion in the right upper lobe with fine line compartments, measuring approximately 32×25×27 mm, with enlarged and moderately enhanced lymph nodes in the 10R, 4R, and 2R regions. Compared to the March 3, 2023 CT, the solid component of the right upper lobe mass had essentially disappeared, and the mediastinal lymph nodes were similar in size.

Physical examination revealed a red, soft mass measuring approximately 20 mm occupying the left EAC. Computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the left EAC and middle ear, as well as in the right upper lung lobe and pancreatic body. The mass in the EAC filled the entire canal and extended into the mastoid, as observed on both CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Laboratory tests showed normal Span-1 and DUPAN2 levels, whereas ProGRP and NSE levels were elevated to 698 pg/mL and 31.1 ng/mL, respectively. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) revealed bilateral mixed hearing loss, with an average threshold of 72.5 dB in the right ear and 78.8 dB in the left ear at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz.

Biopsies were obtained from the EAC, lung, and pancreatic lesions to differentiate between primary and metastatic EAC carcinoma. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of all lesions revealed small round cell tumors with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (Figure 4). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and cytokeratin AE1/3, whereas CK20 was negative in all lesions. The biopsy specimens confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and thyroid transcription factor‐1 (TTF‐1) positivity in the EAC and pancreatic lesions suggested a primary tumor in the lung.

Chemotherapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and zoledronic acid for bone metastases reduced the size of metastatic lesions, including those in the EAC and middle ear. Hearing impairment and otalgia also improved, with PTA showing an improvement in left‐sided mixed hearing loss, reducing the average threshold to 57.5 dB.

The patient survived for 15 months, which is longer than the previously reported survival of approximately 6 months. The favorable response to initial chemotherapy suggests that response to first-line treatment plays a crucial role in overall survival.

Initially, the patient experienced severe hearing loss and regained the ability to understand conversations as the tumor shrank. Otalgia also resolved, allowing the discontinuation of opioid therapy.

- 65-year-old woman
- History of palmoplantar pustulosis
- Diagnosed with small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in both lung and breast masses
- Metastatic lesions detected in multiple bones, peritoneum, and skin

Treatment timeline:

1. Combination therapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab:
	* Anaphylactic shock experienced during treatment
	* Symptoms improved after administration of medications
2. Switched to combination therapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and irinotecan (CPT-11):
	* Significant reductions in both lung and breast masses observed after 4 courses of treatment
3. Pembrolizumab monotherapy:
	* Initiated due to high tumor mutational burden (TMB)
	* Successfully suppressed tumor progression and maintained complete response for over 18 months

Side effects:

1. Anaphylactic shock during combination therapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab
2. Exacerbation of pre-existing palmoplantar pustulosis after initiating pembrolizumab treatment","A 65-year-old woman with a history of palmoplantar pustulosis was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of a breast mass and a chest mass. Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens from both the lung mass and the breast mass revealed small cell carcinoma in both lesions. Metastatic lesion from primary SCLC in right upper lobe and right breast. Stage cT2aN3M1c diagnosis based on comprehensive staging, including contrast-enhanced MRI of brain and FDG-PET. Multiple bone metastases, peritoneal metastases, and skin metastases detected by a PET-CT scan. Primary lesion in right upper lobe and heterogeneous mass in right breast revealed by enhanced chest CT examination. Diffuse proliferation of small tumor cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio on hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Negative synaptophysin and chromogranin staining, but positive INSM1 staining. Anaphylactic shock experienced during first course of treatment with combination therapy of carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab. Following the administration of these medications, the patient’s symptoms improved, and there was no recurrence of the anaphylactic reaction. Given the difficulty in continuing the same regimen, the treatment was switched to combination therapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and irinotecan (CPT-11). After four courses of this treatment, significant reductions in both the lung and breast masses were observed. Analysis of the tumor tissue using the FoundationOne panel revealed a TMB of 10 mutations per megabase (Mb), making the use of pembrolizumab feasible. Additionally, the microsatellite status was stable, and TP53V172F, PTENL128N, RB1loss, SOX2, PIK3CA, and FGF12 amplifications were detected. Pembrolizumab monotherapy successfully suppressed tumor progression and maintained a complete response for over 18 months. One week after initiating Pembrolizumab treatment, the patient developed papules and pustules on both palms and soles.

A low-dose CT chest (Fig. 1) showed a nodule in the right upper lobe of 20 × 20 mm in diameter with a central solid component 7 × 4 mm and an 8-mm diameter ground glass opacity with a central solid dot in the right lower lobe. No lymphadenopathy was detected. He was referred for a CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe. This was followed by the standard positron emission tomography (PET) scan, which showed mild flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the solid component of the nodule and some calcification in his mediastinal lymph nodules with no obvious nodal or distant metastasis. Given a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma stage 1a (cT1cN0M0), he was referred to cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of lobectomy. He was for a video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS); specifically right upper lobectomy/trigsegmentectomy +/− right lower lobe nodule wedge resection +/− segementectomy. He underwent VATS right upper lobectomy and right lower lobe superior segmentectomy. Double-lumen intubation was employed for single lung ventilation.

A conventional right upper lobectomy was first performed and then attention turned to the right lower lobe nodule. The incomplete fissure made dissection of the right lower lobe apical segmental artery and bronchus challenging however, a wedge resection of the lower lobe nodule was sent for frozen section along with several lymph nodes, confirming adenocarcinoma with the absence of lymph node involvement; and he therefore progressed to a lower lobe superior segmentectomy with the view to preserve residual lung function.

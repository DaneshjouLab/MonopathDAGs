Diagnosed with SCLC 15 months previously. Received 6 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, followed by thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. Lost 20 kg of body weight within 12 months. Performance status was recorded (4) on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale on the day of admission. Vital signs: systolic/diastolic blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, oxygen saturation 89%, body temperature 36,9°C/98° F. Laboratory results: hemoglobin 12,6 g/dl (normal range 14-18 g/dl), platelets 260 × 103/μl (150-450 × 103/μl), alkaline phosphatase 94 U/L (26-112 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 40 U/L (5-35 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 34 U/L (<40 U/L), total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, and creatinine 0.9 mg/dl. A large tumor involving the right lower and middle lung lobe measured (17,6 × 19,3 × 18,6) mm (maximal axial x coronal x sagittal dimension), which causes significant compression of the IVC (yellow arrows) mainly at the level of its entry into the right heart atrium. Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, infiltration of the visceral pleura and right hemidiaphragm, ascites, and peritoneal metastases were other salient findings underlining disease progression.

Three self-expanding stents (yellow arrows) were positioned in tandem from the superior vena cava (SVC) (red arrow shows the most cephalic part of the stents) to the IVC to restore venous patency. Fig. 3. The final venography revealed adequate flow through the bridging stents (yellow arrows). The patient's IVCS symptoms, mainly trunk and lower limb edema, were significantly alleviated within 48 h. Low-molecular-weight heparin was administered for anticoagulation.

A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung, raising the suspicion of a malignant tumor (MT). Subsequent positron electron tomography (PET)-CT indicated an irregular lobulated soft tissue mass in the apical segment of the right lung upper lobe, measuring approximately 4.1×3.5 cm and showing increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (SUV value) and spiculated margins, suggestive of lung cancer (likely squamous cell carcinoma). There were tiny nodular shadows about 0.3 cm in diameter surrounding the mass, and the possibility of metastasis was not ruled out. Several enlarged lymph nodes were visible in regions 10R, 4R, and 2R, the largest measuring approximately 1.7 cm in diameter. that showed varying degrees of increased FDG uptake, suggesting possible metastasis in some lymph nodes. On March 3, 2023, a CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe lung mass was performed at our hospital. According to the pathology report (Figure 1), combined with the patient’s medical history and immunohistochemical markers, squamous cell carcinoma was considered (Note: CK7-, CK20-, CK5/6-, NapsinA-, CD56-, P40+, Syn-, CgA-, CD56-, TTF-1-, Ki-67 75%).

Grade III thrombocytopenia occurred post-treatment, with a nadir of 30 × 10^9/L. Immunotherapy regimen was adjusted for the first cycle: tislelizumab 200 mg on d0 + paclitaxel liposome 120 mg on d1, 90 mg on d8 + carboplatin 150 mg on d2, 100 mg on d3-5, every 3 weeks (q3w). However, on May 16, 2023, bacteremia and herpes zoster infection were observed, so antitumor treatment was halted.","Vancomycin was given for anti-infection and anti-viral treatment. After active treatment, the first reexamination on May 29, 2023, with a repeat enhanced chest CT showed an irregular thin-walled cystic lesion in the right upper lobe with fine line compartments, measuring approximately 32×25×27 mm, with enlarged and moderately enhanced lymph nodes in the 10R, 4R, and 2R regions. Compared to the March 3, 2023 CT, the solid component of the right upper lobe mass had essentially disappeared, and the mediastinal lymph nodes were similar in size.

Physical examination revealed a red, soft mass measuring approximately 20 mm occupying the left EAC. Computed tomography (CT) revealed masses in the left EAC and middle ear, as well as in the right upper lung lobe and pancreatic body. The mass in the EAC filled the entire canal and extended into the mastoid, as observed on both CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Laboratory tests showed normal Span-1 and DUPAN2 levels, whereas ProGRP and NSE levels were elevated to 698 pg/mL and 31.1 ng/mL, respectively. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) revealed bilateral mixed hearing loss, with an average threshold of 72.5 dB in the right ear and 78.8 dB in the left ear at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz.

Biopsies were obtained from the EAC, lung, and pancreatic lesions to differentiate between primary and metastatic EAC carcinoma. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of all lesions revealed small round cell tumors with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (Figure 4). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and cytokeratin AE1/3, whereas CK20 was negative in all lesions. The biopsy specimens confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and thyroid transcription factor‐1 (TTF‐1) positivity in the EAC and pancreatic lesions suggested a primary tumor in the lung.

Chemotherapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and zoledronic acid for bone metastases reduced the size of metastatic lesions, including those in the EAC and middle ear. Hearing impairment and otalgia also improved, with PTA showing an improvement in left‐sided mixed hearing loss, reducing the average threshold to 57.5 dB.

The patient survived for 15 months, which is longer than the previously reported survival of approximately 6 months. The favorable response to initial chemotherapy suggests that response to first-line treatment plays a crucial role in overall survival.

Initially, the patient experienced severe hearing loss and regained the ability to understand conversations as the tumor shrank. Otalgia also resolved, allowing the discontinuation of opioid therapy.

- History of palmoplantar pustulosis
- Diagnosed with small cell carcinoma (SCLC) in both lung and breast masses
- Metastatic lesions detected in multiple bones, peritoneum, and skin

Treatment timeline:

1. Combination therapy with carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab:
	* Anaphylactic shock experienced during treatment
	* Symptoms improved after administration of medications
2. Switched to combination therapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and irinotecan (CPT-11):
	* Significant reductions in both lung and breast masses observed after 4 courses of treatment
3. Pembrolizumab monotherapy:
	* Initiated due to high tumor mutational burden (TMB)
	* Successfully suppressed tumor progression and maintained complete response for over 18 months

The patient underwent chemoradiotherapy and achieved a complete response. However, the patient later presented with abdominal pain, and an upper abdominal CT scan revealed abnormal thickening of the gastric wall and a space-occupying lesion in the liver-stomach space. A biopsy confirmed metastases to the stomach, and the patient died 3 months later.

The patient experienced severe abdominal pain on day 5. A follow-up abdominal CT scan showed gastrointestinal perforation (Figure 3) and diffuse peritonitis. Blood cultures were immediately obtained upon admission and returned negative 3 days later. A complete blood count showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.37 × 10^9/L, an elevated C-reactive protein level of 63.34 mg/L, and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam at a dose of 4.5 g twice daily was initiated.

On the third day, an enhanced CT scan of the abdomen was performed again, revealing a small intestinal mass and enlarged peripheral lymph nodes. The CT scan showed reductions in the size of the lesions in the left lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and small intestine (Figure 2). Figure 2. Comparison of lung and small intestinal tumors after the third chemotherapy (August 2021) with those after the first chemotherapy (May 2021), showing significant reduction in size.

The patient was urgently transferred to the gastrointestinal surgery department for an exploratory laparotomy, ileal resection, and anastomosis. Approximately 500 mL of fecal ascites was found in the abdomen and pelvis. A hard mass, approximately 3 cm × 2 cm, was located in the small intestine, approximately 150 cm proximal to the cecum. A perforation with a diameter of about 3 cm was observed at the mesenteric border, resulting in leakage of small intestinal contents.

Postoperative pathology confirmed intestinal necrosis (Figure 4). After the surgery, the abdominal mass was no longer detectable. In October 2021, more than a month after the surgery, the patient underwent chemotherapy again, and the CT scan showed significant reduction in size of the lesions in the left lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and small intestine.

Brain MRI reveals innumerable supra- and infratentorial peripheral enhancing lesions with edema, suggesting intracranial metastases. PET-CT confirms a hypermetabolic left lung mass and mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes compatible with lung cancer. Endobronchial biopsy of the lung mass reveals adenocarcinoma. PDL1 IHC (22C3) was 100%, and IHC testing for HER2 expression was 2+. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing demonstrated HER2 amplification with an average HER2 copy number of >4.0 signals per cell.

Ascitic fluid cytology revealed atypical mesothelial cells that were positive for CK5/6, D2-40 (podoplanin), and calretinin and negative for MOC-31. Omental biopsy revealed epithelioid tumor cells with an infiltrative pattern and cellular atypia (Figure 4), which were positive for AE1/3, CK5/6, CK7, calretinin, D2-40, WT1, and BAP1 but negative for MOC31, synaptophysin, chromogranin, TTF-1, CDX2, and CK20. Based on the histopathological features, a diagnosis of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma was made, 75 days after the patient’s initial presentation. Tuberculosis or other infectious etiologies of ascites were definitively excluded by the results of omental biopsy. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining was instrumental in excluding peritoneal carcinomatosis or metastases from gastrointestinal carcinomas as the cause of malignant ascites. The interventional pulmonary team also performed a left-sided thoracentesis, with the insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter for palliation. Pleural fluid cytology was also positive for malignant cells, with identical markers confirming that this was a malignant pleural effusion associated with the peritoneal mesothelioma. Figure 3.

Elevated anti-voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (739 pmol/L) and anti-LGI1 antibodies (1/300) in serum. Anti-CASPR2 were negative. Anti-LGI1 antibodies in CSF were weakly positive (titre ½). Thyroid hormone levels, tumour markers (CEA, CA125, CA15.3, β-HCG) and C reactive protein were normal.

An EEG on the day of admission showed an irregular, slow background rhythm in the right temporal region.

Histopathological analysis revealed a non-specific (ductal) infiltrative breast carcinoma, histoprognostic grade (SBRm/Nottingham) grade II (3-2-1), without ductal carcinoma in situ. The immunohistochemical study of hormone receptors and HER2/neu indicated the presence of oestrogen receptors (100%) and progesterone receptors (80%). The proliferation index was at 10%, and there was a low immunohistochemical overexpression of HER2 (score 1+).

- Diagnosed with left lung adenocarcinoma (cT4N3M1c, stage IVB) in November 2019.
- Targetable mutation detection revealed G719S/S768I EGFR mutations.
- First-line treatment: afatinib (40 mg daily [qd] by mouth [po]) for 10 months, resulting in stability but development of new brain lesions.
- Second-line treatment: osimertinib (80 mg daily [qd] by mouth [po]), which failed to control brain lesion progression.
- Third-line treatment: afatinib was reverted due to effectiveness of third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment, and both brain and lung lesions remained stable for eight months.
- Fourth-line treatment: almonertinib (220 mg daily [qd] by mouth [po]) led to increased progression in brain lesions after three months.
- Fifth-line treatment: afatinib combined with pemetrexed was initiated due to concerns of potential resistance to afatinib.
- In November 2023, the patient developed multiple metastases in the chest wall, lungs, liver, and brain.

She had a persistent cough for approximately one month. The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was 282 U/mL. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 3.1 cm right lower lobe tumor, lymphadenopathy, right pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Chest CT findings at initial presentation showed a nodule in the lower right lobe (arrow) and accumulation of pleural effusion. Scattered nodules were observed in bilateral breasts. Molecular analysis revealed EML4-ALK fusion gene was detected using Oncomine Dx Test (ODxTT). Histological findings from the biopsy specimens of the lung and breast showed positivity for AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, E-cadherin, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) according to IHC analysis. Findings of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma on hematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunohistopathological analysis demonstrating positive staining for TTF-1. Immunohistopathological analysis demonstrating positive staining for ALK. Original magnification x200. ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase; TTF-1, thyroid transcription factor-1. FISH results for ALK rearrangement. In the biopsy specimens of lung (A) and bilateral breasts (B), FISH analysis using break-apart ALK probes detected ALK rearrangement showing isolated red and green signals along with fused red/green (normal) ones. Additionally, ALK copy number gain was noted in both specimens.

Oral treatment with ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), alectinib (600 mg once a day), was initiated, leading to a substantial reduction of tumor sizes to 1.2 cm. In the breasts, the metastases nearly disappeared and shrank to a maximum size of 4 mm.

Additionally, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and pericardial effusions decreased. The CA 19-9 level decreased to 3.7 U/mL. This therapy is still ongoing, with no evidence of recurrence.

Chest CT findings at six months after the ALK–TKI treatment. (A) CT showing tumor size reduction in the lower right lobe (arrow) and resolution of the pleural effusion. (B) CT in axial (upper) and coronal (bottom) views showing resolution of shadows in bilateral breasts (red circles).

EML4-ALK rearrangements were detected using ODxTT in a lung biopsy specimen.

IHC and FISH were performed separately for ALK rearrangements because ALK expression was proved by IHC in the biopsy specimens of lung and breasts.

The sensitivity of ALK protein detection was 85.7% and the specificity was 100% in IHC for ALK.

graph_099,Inflammatory_Myofibroblastic_Tumor_After_Receiving_Treatment_for_Non_small_Cell__PMC11138368.html,"Patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and obstructive sleep apnea. She underwent a screening low-dose chest CT that showed a new 1-cm spiculated lesion in the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe (RUL). PET-CT showed a markedly hypermetabolic (SUV = 13.1) spiculated RUL pulmonary nodule, consistent with malignancy. The patient underwent a needle biopsy of the RUL nodule, and immunostains were positive for Napsin-A and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), while staining was negative for CK5/6 and P40. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of non-small cell carcinoma, favoring poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, clinical stage T2aN0M0. The patient underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). After completing SBRT, the patient underwent CT scans every six months for the next four years, which showed stable post-radiation fibrosis of the right upper lobe (RUL) and small bilateral pulmonary nodules that intermittently increased and decreased in size, believed to be benign and likely represented previous histoplasmosis fungal infection. Four years after completing SBRT, her chest CT scan showed a new mass in the left upper lobe that measured 3.2 cm × 3.8 cm (Figure2). PET-CT showed a moderately hypermetabolic LUL mass (SUV = 16.2) consistent with bronchogenic carcinoma, with no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The PET-CT also identified a mildly hypermetabolic (SUV = 3.9) left lower lobe (LLL) nodule, concerning for an additional focus of malignancy (Figure3). The patient underwent bronchoscopy and cervical mediastinoscopy. Lymph nodes were sampled from the left and right low paratracheal (L4 and R4) as well as the subcarinal region (station 7), and they were all negative for malignancy. Given the concern for malignancy in the LUL mass, the patient underwent a left upper lobectomy. Histologically, the tumor is composed of fibroinflammatory patterns with variable numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, myofibroblasts, multinucleated cells, and hemosiderin (Figure4). Figure 4. Pathology slides. Immunostains showed that the mass stained positive for CD68, S100, Factor XIIIa, patchy p63, and CD10. It was negative for Napsin, TTF-1, pankeratin, CK8/18, smooth muscle actin, STAT6, CD34, CK5/6, p40, desmin, p53, and ALK-1. Kappa and lambda in situ hybridization showed a polygonal population of plasma cells. A review of the histologic features and the immune profile was most consistent with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?><root><event date="""">Patient is

Multiple variable sized pleural based soft tissue deposits and lytic skeletal lesion in lumbar vertebrae. 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed FDG-avid right-sided lung mass, abdominal lymph node, multiple focal renal lesions, and multiple FDG-avid skeletal lesions. Also showed FDG-avid soft tissue lesion in the pituitary and a peripheral enhancing hypodense soft tissue lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. Right parietal-occipital bone lytic lesion with soft tissue component involvement. Patient presented with severe headaches and blurring of vision for 15 days. Biopsy results confirmed metastatic involvement. Metabolically active soft tissue lesions were noted involving bilateral kidneys with extensive metastasis as seen in the FDG PET/CT scan.",
